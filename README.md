# JavaScript Toaster

This repository contains the Toaster class, a JavaScript system for displaying short, informative messages, commonly known as "toasts", to the user. The Toaster class provides a variety of methods for managing these toasts, such as adding and removing them. The toasts are displayed on a web page and are automatically removed after a specified timeout.

## Usage

To use the Toaster class, create a new instance and provide an HTML element where the toasts should be displayed. You can also provide an options object for further customization.

Both parameters are optional. If none are passed the Toaster will use `document.body` as its parent along with default options.

```javascript
const toaster = new Toaster(document.body, {
  defaultTimeout: 5000,
  toasterPrefix: 'my-toaster-',
  toastPrefix: 'my-toast-',
});
```

To display a toast, simply call the `addToast` method with the desired message and timeout (optional).

```javascript
toaster.addToast('Hello, world!', 3000);
```
